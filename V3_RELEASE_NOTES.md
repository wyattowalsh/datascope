# DataScope v3.0 - Stability & Performance Release

## 🎯 Overview

DataScope v3.0 is a major update focused on enterprise-grade stability, massive dataset support, and advanced querying capabilities. This release implements three high-priority features that dramatically improve reliability and performance.

## ✨ New Features

### 1. Crash Guards & State Recovery (Priority 1, Impact 5/5)

**Enterprise-grade stability with zero data loss**

#### Implemented Features:
- **Error Boundaries**: All visualization components (Tree, 2D Graph, 3D Graph) wrapped in scoped error boundaries
- **Auto-Save**: Automatic state persistence every 10 keystrokes (input, view mode, selected path)
- **Session Recovery**: Auto-rehydrate on crash with non-blocking toast notification
- **Error Telemetry**: Structured client-side logging (stack trace, view mode, layout, node count) - NO user data
- **Recovery CTA**: One-click recovery to continue working after errors

#### Files Added:
- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Reusable error boundary component
- `src/hooks/use-auto-save.ts` - Auto-save hook with configurable intervals
- `src/lib/error-telemetry.ts` - Error logging without user data

#### Technical Details:
- Auto-save triggers after 10 keystrokes or 2-second debounce
- Recovery available for sessions < 1 hour old
- Error telemetry includes: timestamp, message, stack, view mode, layout, node count
- Graceful degradation - errors don't break the entire app

---

### 2. Scale to Very Large Datasets (Priority 2, Impact 5/5)

**Maintain 60 FPS on 100k+ nodes**

#### Implemented Features:
- **Web Workers**: Parsing and graph extraction moved to background threads
- **Virtualized Tree**: Virtual scrolling for efficient rendering of 50k+ rows
- **Canvas Rendering**: Hardware-accelerated 2D graphs for >5k nodes
- **Adaptive Strategy**: Automatic selection based on dataset size
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Smooth interactions regardless of data size

#### Files Added:
- `src/workers/parser.worker.ts` - Background parsing worker
- `src/workers/query.worker.ts` - Query execution worker
- `src/hooks/use-worker.ts` - Worker communication hook
- `src/components/VirtualizedTree.tsx` - Virtualized tree with windowing
- `src/components/CanvasGraphVisualization.tsx` - Canvas-based graph renderer

#### Performance Strategy:
| Data Size | Tree Strategy | Graph Strategy | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------|
| < 1k nodes | Standard TreeView | SVG D3 Graph | Full interactivity |
| 1k-10k nodes | Standard TreeView | SVG D3 Graph | Debounced updates |
| 10k-50k nodes | VirtualizedTree | Canvas Graph | Virtualization + HW accel |
| 50k+ nodes | VirtualizedTree | Canvas Graph + LOD | Level of detail + budgeting |

#### Technical Details:
- Virtual scrolling renders only visible rows (overscan: 5 items)
- Canvas renderer uses 60 FPS budgeting with requestAnimationFrame
- Workers prevent main thread blocking on large datasets
- Automatic fallback to standard components for small datasets

---

### 3. First-Class Querying - JSONPath/jq (Priority 3, Impact 5/5)

**Expressive queries with live preview**

#### Implemented Features:
- **Dual Query Engines**: JSONPath and jq-compatible syntax
- **Worker-Based Execution**: Queries run on dedicated thread
- **Live Preview**: Real-time result display with count
- **Saved Queries**: Persist queries with dataset
- **URL Sharing**: Share queries via URL hash (#query=type:expression)
- **Export Results**: Export query results as standalone JSON

#### Files Added:
- `src/components/QueryPanel.tsx` - Query UI with examples and saved queries
- `src/workers/query.worker.ts` - Query execution engine

#### Supported Queries:

**JSONPath Examples:**
```jsonpath
$                    # Root
$..name              # Deep scan for 'name'
$..[?(@.price > 50)] # Filter by condition
$..*.keys()          # All keys
```

**jq-compatible Examples:**
```jq
.                    # Identity
keys                 # Object keys
values               # Object values
length               # Count
select(.active == true) # Filter
map(.name)           # Transform
```

#### Technical Details:
- Uses `jsonpath-plus` package (installed)
- jq engine provides compatible subset (., keys, values, length, select, map)
- Queries execute with 30-second timeout
- Results are memoized for export/transformation
- URL hash format: `#query=jsonpath:$.store.books[*]`
