- Parse button to process the data

### Visualization Panel
After parsing, you'll see three view modes:
- **Tree** - Hierarchical structure with expand/collapse
- **2D Graph** - Interactive force-directed graph
- **3D Graph** - 3D spatial visualization

### Right Sidebar
Multiple analysis panels:
- Quick Actions - Common operations
- Advanced Search - Regex and type filters
