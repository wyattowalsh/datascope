## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### Preferred Method

Report privately through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/datascope/security/advisories/new)

### Alternative

Email: opensource-security@github.com

### What to Include

- Type of issue (XSS, injection, etc.)
- Source file paths
- Location (tag/branch/commit)
- Steps to reproduce
- Proof-of-concept code
- Impact assessment

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response:** Within 48 hours
- **Status Update:** Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline:**
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 14 days
  - Medium: 30 days

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

**Data Privacy:**
- All processing happens in your browser
- No server storage
- Uses IndexedDB for persistence
- No data analytics

**Safe Usage:**
- Only load data from trusted sources
- Avoid pasting credentials or API keys
- Be cautious with untrusted URLs
- Keep browser updated

### For Developers

**Input Validation:**
```typescript
// ✅ Sanitize user input
const sanitized = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput)

// ✅ Validate URLs
if (!/^https?:\/\//.test(url)) throw new Error('Invalid URL')

// ✅ Limit data size
if (data.length > MAX_SIZE) throw new Error('Data too large')
```

**Dependencies:**
- Regular `npm audit` checks
- Automated updates via GitHub Actions
- Browser-compatible packages only

## Known Security Considerations

### Client-Side Processing
- No data transmitted to servers
- User controls all data
- No backend attack surface

### Browser Storage
- IndexedDB persists across sessions
- Not encrypted at rest
- Clear on shared devices

## Vulnerability Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure:
1. Private report
2. Acknowledgment within 48 hours
3. Investigation and fix
4. Coordinated public release

### Recognition

Responsible researchers will be:
- Acknowledged in advisories
- Listed in SECURITY_ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.md
- Thanked in release notes
