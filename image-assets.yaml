# Additional notes:
# - All gradients should use the app's color palette: primary (indigo/purple #5668e8), accent (cyan/teal #66d9ef)
# - Maintain consistent visual style across all assets (modern, minimalist, tech-forward)
# - Ensure all icons work well at multiple sizes (minimum 24px for UI icons)
# - Consider light and dark mode compatibility
# - Use smooth gradients and subtle glow effects for premium feel
# - Keep file sizes reasonable for web (optimize PNGs, use appropriate compression)
